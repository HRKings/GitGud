Pull Requests, or PRs, are the main to share your changes with other developers and ask for feedback. Once you open a pull request, other people working in the project are notified that you completed a feature and you can discuss and review the changes before they are merged in another branch.

They are also a way to merge changes from a fork into the main repository when contributing to other projects.

## 1 - How to write a good Pull Request

When writing a pull request you need to make sure that other people understand what changes you are proposing.

### 1.1 - Title

The title is a short description of what the Pull Request proposes, keep it short and informative.

You can also put some tags and flags in the title to give more information at glance. In which you can use the same rules proposed in the [Commit Message Style Guide](Commit.md), but is recommended to use the labeling feature of your platform.

### 1.2 - Body

Here is where you can really explain why you made those changes, put bullet list and let others know why those changes are important.

- When writing the why, don't assume that the person reading has familiarity with the history behind the changes.

- Remember to be informative, as this Pull Request could be read later and help others in the future. Not only the ones involved in the discussion.

- Link resources relevant to the changes, a specific page of the documentation if needed, a link to a document explaining the model or roadmap, a image showing a part of a conversation on other platform about the issue. Just remember to not clutter the body with unrelated information.

- You can also ask for a specific review or feedback, a quick look, a technical approach to the changes and the code, a critique on the design or a discussion on the changes.

- You can mention individuals to call them to the discussion, use the tools at your disposal, the assign and the labels.

- Remember to reference issues related to the Pull Request. This will help give context to the person reading and provide more information on why the changes were made.

- If the body gets too long, put a TL;DR on the top so people can get a briefing of what was wrote.

### 1.3 - The Footer

The footer is where you can close or reference more issues. A `Resolve #123` would close the issue numbered 123 when the Pull Request were approved.

## 2 - How to offer good feedback

Feedback is the one of the main objectives of the Pull Requests, and offering good feedback can improve a lot the quality of the code and the repository in general.

- First you need to familiarize with the context of the issue and the reasons why this Pull Request exists, read the body carefully.

- If you disagree strongly, give some time before responding and don't use derogatory terms, like "stupid", when referring to the work someone has made; always think before you act, the code is not more important than the people you are dealing with.

- Ask, don't tell. For example, say "What do you think about trying...?" instead of "Don't do..."

- Explain the reasons of why the code should be changed. If they are not in line with the repository style or if it is a personal preference, for example.

- Offer ways to simplify and improve the code, try to learn together.

- Be humble, everyone is in this together.

- Avoid hyperbole. *Never say never*, you can't be sure if this will be needed in future.

- Be aware of negative bias when writing, we assume a negative tone when the content is neutral. Keep a positive language as opposed to neutral.

- If comfortable, use emoji or emoticons. It helps making your comment more expressive and avoid negative or neutral content. And it helps to give a moral boost to the author of the Pull Request.

- Always aim to be develop professional skills and incentive a good peaceful discussion, develop group knowledge and product quality.

## 3 - How to respond to feedback

Responding to feedback is essential, but you need to keep in mind somethings:

- Consider leading with a expression of appreciation, this incentives people to give you more feedback.

- Ask for clarification, you can say, for example, "I didn't understand, can you clarify... ?".

- Offer clarification and explain the decisions you made to reach a solution in question.

- Link to any follow up commits or Pull Requests. (â€œGood call! Done in #123")

- If there is growing confusion or debate, ask yourself if written word is still the best form of communication. Talk virtually face-to-face, invite people to a voice call and at same time post a follow-up to summarize any discussion made outside the original platform, this is useful for other who are following along, now or in the future.
